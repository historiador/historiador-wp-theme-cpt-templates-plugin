Historiador Custom Post Types Templates Plugin
==============================================

THIS PLUGIN IS NOT WORKING.  While the sidebars are registered properly,
the template files are not, regardless of whether they are placed at the
root of this directory or at a subdirectory.  There needs to be another
function that would include template files and which would allow
overriding them from within the theme.




This is a companion plugin for the Historiador WordPress Theme[1].  It
is meant to work in tandem with the Historiador Custom Post Types
Plugin[2].

It adds template files for archives and single posts to all of the 
registered CPTs.

The rationale of decoupling the templates from the main theme is to keep 
the latter small and portable.
